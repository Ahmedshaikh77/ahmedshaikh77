## 👋 About Me

I’m **Muhammad Ahmed Nazir Shaikh**, an MS student in **Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science at Duke University**, focusing on **robotics** and **medical/assistive devices**.

- I love building robots that combine **mechanical design, control, and AI** from simulation to real hardware.
- Very interested in **medical robotics**, especially systems that support **rehab, therapy, and patient care** (like neuro-adaptive companions and feeding-tube assist devices).
- Hands-on with **ROS 2, Python, C++, CAD (Fusion 360), embedded systems, and Jetson/Raspberry Pi** for perception, control, and prototyping.
- Experience as a **Teaching Assistant** (thermodynamics/experimental methods), where I help students connect theory with real engineering systems.
- Currently exploring **SLAM, motion planning, human–robot interaction, and soft/assistive robotics** through projects and coursework.
- Long-term goal: build **human-centered robots for healthcare** that are safe, intuitive, and actually useful to clinicians and patients.
